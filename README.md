# FotoForge
Hey all, ready to forge some photos? Thanks to FotoForge you can, using an all new, easy to use photo manipulation software stright out of the Pixel-Smiths' horrid cave. The software is available to use on any device that has Python 3.12 installed. Inside you will find several features designed to make photo editing easy for beginners, as well as tools advanced users will appreciate. 

# Functionalities
### LAYERS
FotoForge uses a layer system to stack images on top of each other. This allows users to create collages of images, and add elements from one image to another. Changes made to the images depend on which layer is selected, as each image is automatically associated with its own layer. Remember FotoForgers, a change is only made to the specific layer selected, to ensure precise control over what elements you would like to change. Layers can be accessed from the main screen, by clicking the "create layer button". The system will prompt the user to select an image from their files, and adds it to the canvas. Clicking the layer button associated with an image allows the user to input an Opacity percentage, from 0-100. 

### TOOLS 
Several tools exist in FotoForge, for your foto forging pleasure. These are the text tool, the drawing tool, fill tool, manipulation tool, and layering. This allows the user to make manipulations to various layers of images and make a fun design!
